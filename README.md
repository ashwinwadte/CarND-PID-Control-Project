## Overwiew

I implemented a PID controller for the steering angle of a self_driving car in C++. The steering wheel value depends on the Cross Track Error (CTE) defined as the displacement error from the center of the line.

## Output

Here is the video output of the project's run on simulator: [Output Video](./output_PID_Controller.mp4)

## Hyperparameters

#### Proportional component - P:
The Proportional component - P is acts on the current displacement error. A high value will lead to a very sudden adjustement which may give an unstable behavior. Whereas, a very low value will lead to a smooth response, but not enough for keeping the car on the track.

#### Integral component - I:
The Integral component - I acts on the steady-state behavior and helps correct the steering bias, such as a constant mis-orientation of the wheels. During the tuning, it is observed that if it's too high, overshoot is experienced.

#### Derivative component - D:
The Derivative component - D acts on the difference between the current error and the previous error. It can be observed that when it is too high, overshoot and instability is there. If it's too low, the vehicle will react too slowly and it will drive off the track.

## Tuning

### Manual tuning

The PID parameters were first tuned manually. Each parameter was tuned with the other two params set to 0, in order to see single effects of the tunes. This gave the values used for initialization and starting point for the twiddle algorithm.

### Twiddle

After the manual tuning, twiddle algorithm was used. This lead to small changes in the I and D param and little more change in P param.

Parameter | Manual | Twiddle |
|:-------:|:------:|:-------:|
|P        | 0.15   | 0.1600  |
|I        | 0.005  | 0.005001|
|D        | 5.0    | 5.00106 |

    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
